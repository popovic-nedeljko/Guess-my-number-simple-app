Mini application gamein which the goal is to guess the random generated number, from 1 to 25.

A responsive user interface for a number guessing game was developed using JavaScript.

The game's functionality was implemented using fundamental JavaScript concepts such as addEventListeners, reset logic, else-if statements, truthy and falsy values, the equality operator, string and template literals and DOM manipulation

The implementation of a highscore feature involved the use of conditional statements, type conversion and coercion, and a random number generator to create a challenging gameplay experience.

The messaging system in the game was made responsive using the ternary operator, boolean logic, and template literals, providing users with instant feedback and increasing user engagement.

Arrays were used to store and manipulate game data, enabling the creation of features like a highscore leaderboard and a reset button for a more immersive gaming experience.
